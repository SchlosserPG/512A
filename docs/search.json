This means that the command does some math calculation (mean, sum, etc.) on a continuous variable after dividing the data by group.\n\nThe format is tapply(x, index, and fun), where x is a continuous variable, index is a grouping variable or factor, and fun is a function like mean.\nMore on that function later in the first lessons.",
